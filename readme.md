I like to design and build things.

I'm...

- Familiar with several programming languages including Gleam, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, PHP, and Python.

- Comfortable in the command line and has experience operating a Linux-based web server.

- Interested in gaining more low-level skills, learning Swift & SwiftUI, and adopting a [hypermedia based approach](https://htmx.org/) for building web apps.

Some projects I've worked on:

- [asm.zip](https://asm.zip/) - Free URL shortener (frontend)
- [dreamscribe](https://dreamscribe.pages.dev/) - Online dream journal
- [LitePipe](https://github.com/lia-07/litepipe) - A super simple CI/CD tool written in Go

Between my part time job and school I don't have much time to work on projects, unfortunately.
